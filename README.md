Task 2 EDA
First we import necessary libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
Then we import the dataset
Then we check we for empty values in the dataset
With the help of heatmap we visualize the null values and we find that ther are empty values is age and class entities
We then visualise the survived people from the dataset using countplot
We then visualise the male and female  survived from the dataset
We then visualise the people survived from each Passenger class
We then plot a displot of age and drop the null values
We then visualise the count of sibilings-spouse.
We then plot a box plot of age and fare and we found the average age for each pclass
We then create a function and if the person is one of the classes and fill it with the average age if that class
We find that there are many null values in Cabin entity and we drop that entity
